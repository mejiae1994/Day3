            <h2>Video Game</h2>
            <p> I've been a gamer since I was about 9 years old. I started gaming when the super nintendo was around. I used to own the super nintendo and even the gameboy color back then. Gaming has been a hobby that has helped me stay away from activities that would have otherwised affected my life in a negative way. The type of games that interest me the most are those that pose a challenge and that have rpg elements in them such as leveling and character progression.
